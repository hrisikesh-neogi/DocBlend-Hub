       "{'text': \" Hello everyone, so welcome to another video of this advanced python series So this is the third video of this series. So till so far we have discussed about water meta classes and water decorators. And we have seen like there are two types of things we can do to achieve meta programming in Python, right. So, one is basically the decoletors and one is metadlases. So, in the previous video if you have seen so, I have discussed about the decoytrus in python and in this particular video we are going to discuss about what are meta classes and how we can use metaasses. So, basically you will see the structure how Python has used Metaclasses and how type has been used. So, these things will be covering in this previous video. So, stay tuned and I will see you. Music Thank you. So, if you have not seen the previous video, the link in the i button. And in the previous video, I have discussed about the Python decoders and how we can utilize these decoders and basically the coding part I have discussed. So just refer the video in the i button and I have uploaded the code in the GitHub also you can refer that also. So, just note this repository ok. node desipository. Okay, node desipository I will be uploading all the materials and notes here in this repository itself. Fine. So now if I just go to the Python's official documentation. So as you can see this is the Python's official documentation. So they have written something in meta classes. So what are meta classes actually? So by default classes are constructed using type. So the type we check like to check any kind of data type right. So, this is this is why like it happens. So, by default classes are constructed using type ok. The class body is executed in a new namespace and the class name is bound locally to the result of type name basis and name spaces. So, these things I will be discussing later. So, let us just see the example here. So the class creation process can be customized by passing the meta class keyword argument in the class definition line or by inheriting from an existing class that included such an argument. So in the following example, both my class and my subclass are instances of meta. Now, let us see. So, as you can see the meta is the meta class and they have inherited the type class. So, type is also a class in Python. So, they are first for created a meta class by inheriting the type class and then they have created a class including the meta class as meta. So, this they have created then they have united the my class into my subclass. This is a simple example. So by this definition you can say one thing, let us suppose if we are defining some function just that is a single object, but if you are building a class,, all the class methods and all the things are basically structured by the class itself. And the class itself and the class itself is structured by a class called type in Python. So, in simple words, so type is the meta class in Python, all the Python classes are using type as default Metaclash. So, that is a thing. So, in simple words you can say Metacl class is it class of a class that defines how a class will behave. So, in Python by default the type is the meta class of every class that we create, but you can create your custom meta classes also. So, the thing is like in Python you know like a class defines how the instance of the class will be treated or maybe how the instance of the class will be working right. So same way, a meta class is a class of a class. So, this meta class is defines how the class will act or be f right. So, this is the basically this is the philosophy of meta classes. So, now let us jump into the coding part. So, let us now see what are the things we are going to cover in this today's video. So first of all there will be introduction to Python Metaclasses and then we'll be talking about how everything in Python is an object that will be creating some Python classes or maybe functions. So and we'll see how these things are being an opposite to python. And allocation single memory for every object. So that also we will go into see and then we will prove something proof type is the meta class for every Poisson class how we are going to see this how the like we are saying that type is a meta class of every class that we create, but how. So, that thing we will be proving there. And then there is the fourth point create classes dynamically with type as meta class. So, the way we create classes, the class then the class name. So, then we just construct the class. So, we will be just creating the class with the type as a meter class dynamically, okay, not with the like structured way that we really follow ok. And same thing we will be doing dynamic inheritance with type meta class. So, it is kind of fun you can say or maybe some creative ways to create classes or maybe those things. So, these things will be you can take care of, so dynamic inheritance with type meta class. So, then we will be explaining some of the magic methods like underscore class, underscore. So, class method and these things will be explaining. And finally, we will be creating some custom meta classes. We will see how to create custom meta classes and when to use these things so that thing will be covering in this 7th point And then in 8th point we will be using the new and init methods. What are the differences between new and init it and how we can utilize them both new and in it and the differences and similarities between them. Okay. So these these things are covering this 8 point and finally, the call method and its uses. So, it is very useful. Okay so how Python takes this call method. So these things will be taking care of in this ninth point. And finally, in tenth point we will be doing something called single-tone design with metaclasm python. single ton design with Metaclash in Python. Single ton design means like a class can have only one instance. So, things, you can see here, singleton is a creational design pattern which ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides a single point of access to it for any other code. So, this is called single term. So, this thing will be covering how to create singleton design with Metaclas in Python. Okay, I hope this is pretty clear. What and all things we are going to cover in this video. Okay, so let's now proceed with the practical part of meta classes, okay. So what and all things we are going to cover? Scope in paste, 1, 1, 1, we will see here. So, first thing first, so introduction to pattern metacloss is completed I guess as you can see. So, in python what is a metacloss if I say this revision? A Metacloss is a class that defines the behavior and structure of other classes, ok. It is quite simple, guess often referred to as class factories. In simple terms a meta class is a class for classes, just as a class defines the behavior and attributes of each instances of that class. And similarly, a meta class defense behavior of attribute soft classes ok same thing. So, some of the key points to understand our meta classes in Python are everything in Python is an opposite right In Python classes themselves are objects. They are instances of meta classes, ok. So, a class is the instance of metaclasses and let us suppose you create some instance of classes that means you define a class and then you just pass it to the like this you can say this example there is a class right. So, we are just creating an object. So, this is the instance of the class right. Similarly, a class is the instance of meta class. So, this is the meta class see. So, the my class is the instance of my meta, okay fine, okay. Now customizing class creation. So what we can do, key, meta classes allow you to customize how classes are created. You can intervene the class creation process, modify attributes and methods and or you can enforce coding standards for classes. Okay fine and the third thing is key inheritance chain. In Python class creation is often controlled by an inheritance chain. When you define a class it inherits properties and methods from its base class, usually object or other classes. So meta, metaclasses can affect this inheritance chain you can do this. So, these things are key points actually. And it is a simple example how we can create Metaglass, but we will see in the next like we will see in the later one, we will see later in this tutorial. So, do not get worried about this. So, just let us get started from the second point. So, introduction is done. Now we will see how everything in Python is an object. How? Okay. So just say keep in Python everything is an object, everything is an object, so class, functions and variables, whatever we define, everything is an object in Python.. So let's just see it how it is happening. Let you know create a class okay. Let's simple class. So first one, first point is how everything is Python is not object. it. Thank you. Okay, so we'll create a simple class named like let us suppose a, b, c and this simple whatever just print on maybe just pass it better. Now let's create an instance of this abc cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc So now we have created the class simple thing and we have just created an instance of this class right. So if I just print the class now instance sorry if I just print the instance now. So you can see it has created some option right and this is some unusual numbers. So what are these things? So this thing is actually showing the memory location of the instance ABC and this is the hexadecimal number actually. So, it is a unique location id for each and only of the object. So you just create anything and then we will have this ID in your memory. Okay, so I hope this is clear. And similarly you can say you can see see everything is an option in Python. Okay, same thing I just create a function. So we just print. So, this is the function and this is the memory location right. So, everything in Python seems to be an object right. So this is the point when you can say this. Let's move to the next point. So proof type is the meta class for every Python class. How we are going to see? Let's see. So as we can say we have created the class write ABC. So, that same example we will talking about ABC. So, ABC is the instance of ABC right. Yep. So, if I just print abc just type and then just print it. So, you will see key main.abc that means main is this module whatever this notebook is and dot abc abc is a class of this ok. So, you just say, us suppose ABC dot underscore class, anyhow we will see the class letter, but let us see what it does actually. It actually gives you the class names of the instance. Similarly, if I just run same thing again class, so here I will see I will show you one thing ok. So, what happens here we just getting type, why type. So, if I just remove this so we get a bc right and abc instance of something and that something is type. Got it. So this small case abc is the instant of abc class, right this one. So, we are getting the abc and the abc is an instance of type that is why you are getting type. So it is funny I know but it is somehow misleads us to know what type actually is. So, let us see what type actually is. So, if I just check one thing type of let us suppose ABC is an instance right. So, it will give us ABC is the ABC class right. it's an instance of abc class so that is how you're getting abc it's fine no magic here but if I just check a b c it's the class name right it's a class name see if I just check this type, we are getting type. So same thing if you just refer to my video, any of the video link in other video link of this explanation is on the i button, is on the i button, go check it out. So, go check it out ok otherwise you can see so we can say key let us suppose we can write it here. So abc is an instance of a BC class right similarly. Similarly, ABC class, if the actually can say FD class that we create is an instance of a Metacloss in Python it is by default is an instance of type. Now same thing if I just check type of type it's funny. It is funny let us see again we are getting type that means type itself is a meta class of type class right. So, same thing same diagram if you just follow go to the first video of this playlist you can see this. Okay, so how this is happening, we are not going to go into the much deeper because that is not our task here. So this is why you can say key type is a meta class for every class that you create in python right or if I just create a new single other class or maybe we can import something right, import pandas maybe. So now if I just import pd, just import in So, it is important to check the type of PD. It is a module right? So just have to create a call class. Let's suppose pd.datafrim maybe data will be I for I range 10 okay we got it right. So, let us suppose it says something df ok and if I just create a type of DF, we is a data frame right. Now if I just check the type of this one, data frame. So, data frame is a class, right? So, now if I just check the type of data frame, right? So, isn't it is Amazon right. Whatever class we have and whatever class we are creating that is by default the instance of the type meta class. So, this is how meta class is a single entity for a free class that you create in Python right. So, what if we could create our own meta class? So, that will be much more beneficial for our use cases sometimes not every time. So, that is the thing, but yeah. So, but in this way we can say key type is the meta class for every class that we create in Python. Right. Okay. Fine. So let's move to the next point. So next point is create classes dynamically with type as a meta class. So let's me just write it first. So, how usually we create the Python classes this way right this is the Python class and we just simply just write something called underscore init and just we pass something right. So, these things we have been doing since we have been introduced to Python right. But there might be some other ways to do it right how so let's see it how we are going to create classes dynamically with type as a meta class. So let us now see how we can create the classes dynamically with Python. So usually we create Python classes like this right. So, we define some class and we define some unit methods and maybe constructors whatever. So, just create classes in this way right and then we create some instance of it and then we access the functionalities or methods right. So, this is the usual way we deal with Python classes right, but what if I tell you you there is other ways to create classes dynamically. So let's suppose there is a class and I am creating a, let us just to give you the similarity. So, this is the class of a, or maybe like like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, like, fong or maybe custom class, okay. Okay. So this is a custom class and we are just passing whatever we don't need anything. So CLS is equal to custom class and we just print cls we will get to know what is it, it is an instance of custom class right same way ok if we just comment it out ok. So, now if we just do one thing same thing we are going to do. So what is the name of the class? Custom plus right? Let's get a variable and then we'll be passing the type meta class here. Okay. And what is the name of the class? Let's suppose this is the name, right? It's a powerful name. Okay, so the type meta class takes three arguments, one is the class name, in strings and then we will get to pass. If we are doing any inheritance, we will pass this otherwise we will keep it blank in parenthesis okay. I'll show you when next mind when you create some inheritance and then we'll pass the parameters. So if you have any parameters, we can pass it as dictionaries otherwise just skip it blank. Okay. Okay. So now just this is a class we have created okay, so is it funny right can you create it like can you create a class like this? No, right. We have, so we just create custom class and let's suppose cs cls ok, let us print it and if it is print cls, see it is a offset of custom class, right? Same thing, let's do one thing, let's pass some attributes, okay. Let's pass some attributes. Okay. Let's suppose name and what is my name? Okay. We have to give it a strings. Okay. give it and strings name my name is rjk is right so Okay, so now I will just pass it okay so I want to print the name see so isn't it amazing, right? So we have just created a class by not using the class keyword, right? So we just have created a class by using only that type meta class right. So this is how we can create classes also and this is called the dynamic class creation. So, we can pass any number of parameters we choose, okay, whatever you feel. Let's suppose you tube channel name. So what is my YouTube channel? Which is AI and release, left right, pass it, you can pass this thing, see let's start. Obviously, we have to take care of these things should be syntactically correct. right you got it right. So, this is the way we can create classes dynamically in Python with the type meta class right. Let us move to the next point now. So, it is our next point dynamic inheritance with type planter class, dynamic inheritance with type meta class. So let's see how we can use this. I hope you are having fun learning these things. So, if you just like it, just subscribe to the channel ok. Thanks. So, now let us move to the next point dynamic inheritance with type Metacloss. How we are going to achieve this. So, we have created a class called custom class, right. So, we have to inherit this class, let us suppose. So, now create the same kind of thing, just copy it and paste it. So, I will change the name custom class let's suppose 0 1 okay and it will be 0 1 and we will inherit it in this time. So we have to give the class name custom class done. So, we will call the class name and we pass some other parameters, let's suppose, h, so I am 23 and let us suppose whatever. whatever job okay so I'll just do it. industry data, send, test, okay. Let me say experience two. Never just pass, just call this, why this? So, why this error has come? Let us see. So, in Python, if you just have to create a tuple with a single element, right? So, we have to create a tuple with a single element right so we have to pass a trailing comma otherwise the python wouldn't take it as a tuple, single element tuple. So this is a syntactical like requirement we have to pass, just trailing comma we have to pass. Okay, so after the class, we have to pass a trailing comma. Now, let's run it. Now, there is no way right it has occurred. Now let's see the unit edge is working or not. CLS 0 1. cls01.c we have everything name, job, experience, age, everything, right. And the magical thing is key. We have not created any class with the class keyword. Everything I have done with the time meter class itself. Till so far whatever class we have defined whatever class we have created, everything we have created with the type meta class. So this is a new way we can create classes and this is more often easy maybe. So, somehow we can create this pass name, pass the attributes and if you want to inherit something, they're passing inheritance. Like, pass the parent class name, parent class object actually okay so same thing we have done and if I just call this name we, we don't have anything called name here, right? Because we have inherited the previous class. If you just pass the name, we got this from here, right? We got the YouTube channel, right? Okay. So we have to take care of the naming conventions. Thank you. We got the attributes of the previous like parent classes right. So, this is somehow, somehow tricky right and you also. So, we have created classes dynamically with type, we have created inheritance with type. So, these two things are very much useful and handy when you use python for your projects on maybe some frameworks or those things. So, let us now move to the next point. I hope till so far you have understood the points and if you have not, if you have any query, let me know in the comments. So now we will explain the 6th point, what is the class method here. I will explain the class method here. So, let us now use this. Okay. So, one thing to notice, the class is not a meter actually ok. It is just a attribute, it is just a special attribute that helps us to know the class of an object. So, let us suppose we have imported pandas write df, we have df now what is that class of data print. Similarly, same thing I have checked, right? we have we know same thing right so by this we can say key whatever the type is printing the same thing we can print with the underscore class method class attribute right. So this class attribute right. So, this class attribute helps us to know what is the class of the instance right. So, same thing we can see if we type right. So this is handy also. So this class method actually helps you to know the parent classes in the runtime. So, it helps you to know this like what are the class belongs to and just for debugging or maybe to create dynamic ways. So, we can inherit those things. So, these things are pretty much identified. Similarly, we have something called name. What is the name? So, it is not that much important, but I have kept it in this video. So, let's suppose the ABC is the object, right? So, if you just create the name, I'm going to be class class dot just going name So, the name we are getting from the here itself. So, this is the name actually, this is the name by default and how we are getting the name. So, it just notice one thing, we have passed one thing, same name, right? If you just pass the other things, let's suppose wonder, okay, if you just pass this now. So, if I want to check the type of CLS, so I have to show you one thing that previously if I just call this, cless.class.name. So we are getting custom class, same right, but if I just wonder right wonder So you get wonder when I'm getting this class name, right? So by default, we just use the class keyword to create your classes. Your class name is a name by default and if you just create dynamic classes, you have to pass the name here. So now one thing I'm going to right now, I can go to the type, the definition of type, okay ok let us go there. So, you can see there is something the base and dict and all those things. There is not it's not important. You can see there is underscore name and there are the new methods, they are call methods, everything. So not everything is our task to know. So, these are attributes in the type definition right. So, we will not go into much depth here because that is not our task here. So this is how we can get to know the class names here. I just remove it. So now you got to know what is the name and what is the class doing here. So this thing we can create, we can call these things and we can know what are the class names and what are the class objects right. So, that we can help it to get to know about the details of the class or the obtained senses. So, this is handy. Again not a big deal ok. So, then now finally, we are going to create custom met classes. Now this is the point we all were waiting for. So let's get to geometry is custom across creation. So, let's get to jump into this. So, let's now create a meta class. Okay. So same thing, just create a class. Okay. Let's suppose meta class. Okay. suppose metaclass and we have to inherit the type metaclass by default ok, of course the metaclass ok. fold okay, good is the meter class okay. So now we can just pass it okay initially just pass it okay. Now create a another class with simple test maybe, pass it and now let's create a class with the meta class custom meta class, okay, custom... class okay. Let us now pass the meta class keyword class equal to meta class fine okay so let's run this one by one now we are going to paint it. Now, the first of all paint the simple class that is test right now we are going to print the class of this one right custom class. Let us print this now. So, as you can see this is the class of test and this is the class term class with meta. So, this is the class of test and this is the class term class with meta. So, this is the class of test and this is the class term class with meta. So, this is the class of test and this is the class term class with meta. So, this is the class with meta. So, this is the class of test and this is the class term class with meta. So, this is the class of test and this is the class term class with meta. So, this is the class with meta. So, this is the class of test and this is the class term class with meta. So, this is the class of test and this is the class term class with meta. So, this is the class with meta. So, this is the class of test and this is the class term class with meta. So, this is the class of test and this is the class term class with meta. So, this is the class with meta. So, this is the class of test and this is the class term class with meta. So, this is the class of test and this is the class term class with meta. So, this is the class with meta. So, this is the class of test and this is the class term class with meta. So, this is the class of test and this is the class of test and this is the class of test and this is the class of test and this is the class of test and this is the class of test and this is the class with meta. So, this is the class of test and this is the class of test and this is the class with meta. So, this is the class of test and this is the class of test and this is the class beta. So, this is the class of test and this is the class of test and this is the class term class with meta. So now let's see the type of these things. Just type, type. So to print this first of all. So, as you can see, the first class that we have created with the class keyword, the same thing like this is a similar way we create the class. So, this is by default taking the type as meta class, but this particular one, this one custom Metaclass. So, this is taking the Metaclass as the Metaclass, as we have defined the meta class in the definition of the class. So this is how we can create classes. Now more things you can do here, what are the other things you can do. So let's just explore. So I'll be doing it itself. Let us just copy this first for paste it, experiments's fine. Now let's now do some experiments here. Thank you. So, just create a class with name, basis and dictionary. Now, let's do some experiments in the meta classes. So this is a meta class I have created. So this is a meta class and we've been edited the type by default. And the CLS method is associated with it because by default it is going to associate with the class that we are going to create with right and the name we are passing same thing right same name which is the name and the class in if you are inheriting something or maybe it is attribute right this is the base and this is the name we call it name base and attributes right so these are all things we have created here. So this is the pointer and we have name, basis and attributes. So, just to make you clear writing these things. So name is this class name. Bases means the base class or maybe you can say parent class okay and one more thing I'll take the Actibutes, right? attributes right and attributes are the So, you build all you can say parameters to the class. So, that is it and let just do something. So we have created a new attribute. You can create whatever you want. See, let's start. list of class number, this is a class number 3 where do you write so this thing can create here itself right now let's create an instance of the class. So this is the instance of the class. Now we have used the my meta as a meta class similarly to the previous one. So we have used the metalass keyword and we just pass the Metaclass here. And we just created a value. The simple thing and that value we are going to print in this print value function. Simple thing, right? Simple. So now if I just just create an instance of the class, so like my CLS maybe, my class, okay what are what are the things we know we need value right and it will be let's suppose maybe 23 okay now if I just want to keep my CLS dot print value right so it will print the 23, nothing magical, but what if we just want to access these things? So we have not used any kind of inheritance, right? We have just used the Metaclass. So if you just want to check what is the Metaclass here? So just write type of my class and I will see the type of metaclages my meta right. So this is the way we can see otherwise we can say key my cls dot underscore class dot underscore class right we'll go we'll get my meta it is a my meta class right same thing so what are the things we are going to do now? So, let us put my CLS and if you just see we have given some kind of attribute, right? New Attribution class number number let us see new attributes is there right yeah we got it 42 and if you just check the class number, you got it as free right you just pass anything like C restort magic equal to true, yeah it is magic. So, let us just use this as magic, so we got this my meter class as a meter class of this my class right pretty much handy pretty much useful and fun creating these things and maybe learning something new right in some other ways like it is and it is not an usual way we create this thing But yeah, it's some unusual way, but it is fun, it is creative. So we have created classes, we have created custom classes, we have seen how to access the variables of custom class whatever you have just do you can just do one thing like concreative or like let's suppose you are connecting to some database or maybe somehow so we can pass these things to here and it's pretty much handy for you so you don't need to inhead every time. So, it is just a meta class. So, this is how it can be handy. Yeah. Right. So, let us now move to the next point. Let us get some into the next point. So, there comes something interesting that is use of underscore underscore underscore underscore new method. underscore new and in And in it, these are the attributes or the special attributes you can say. So these things we are going to discuss here ok. So, let us now discuss about the new and init methods or attributes ok. So, ok. So, let us now discuss about the new and unique attributes. So, what are the things in Python, both in it and new R special methods used during the creation of initializing objects, right. But they serve different purposes. But what are these things? So new method, what it's actually, so the new method is responsible for creating a new instance of a class before init is called. Okay, I'll explain it more in when we go to the code. So initially usually we define the classes using the init q world write init attribute or maybe magic methods, special methods right. So, but before in it, by default the new is called and it is called by the Metacloss itself right, it is defined there. So, the new and init are both important for to initialize an object of a class. But new comes first when you are dealing with the classes you are creating an instance of the class. So, like if I just show you, so I have created an instance of my class. So, my CLS this one is the instance of my class right. So when you are creating an instance of the class, you can create a enumeration number of instances right. So whenever you are creating an instance, so it is by default, first of all it is calling the new first and then the init. So that is what is happening here. So it is a static method that takes the class as its first argument CLS, right? And returns a new instance of the class okay fine. So you can override new to customize the creation of the instance okay you can just customize it, we have, we will be creating this one and it is often used when dealing with immutable objects or to control object creation in Metacases. So this last one I will show you once will finish it. So the last point we have this one, this one will be creating single tone. If we want to control object creation in Metacluster, these things will be single tone classes we will be defining this thing. So, this is also an point of new and it is called before init and it is used to set up the object state. Okay fine, good to go. So now just create a class with the new method. So, this new we can obviously define it class will be defining here. So, this is the class object we are getting here and so now we are going to create an instance we are just initialing the super class. That means let us suppose we are not inheriting something or just if you are inheriting something or maybe you have a very complex hierarchical inheritance ok. Multiple inheritance inheritance going on. So, these things might be handy for you. So, it does not affect your code, but you can use this is a good practice ok to use super. So, just super of my class. So, it is the basically it is referring to the base class and we just initialize the base classes new method. Same thing. Now, we just initial initializing the values here, whatever we values are getting in arcs or KWs that you can do here, no issues, the simple thing one, simple thing. So then we are getting the instance, now we are written the value here, the new and immediate method. So, these are different here. You will see once we get to know it ok. So now just creating this. So the value we got here for 42. So, now let us check what is happening here. So, in this example, the new methods creates an instance and sets its value attribute based on the argument path should have a constructor. So this is what happened here right you got no point. And if you just print it, we'll see new is called and if you just print this, unit is called this run this. So, first of all, new is called, then it is called then 42. And also wanting to notice notice new actually decides whether to call the init or not. Fine. Yep. So this is a simple example of new and let us see what is the init method. So, the init method is responsible for initializing the created instance after it has been created by new. So, the instance is created by new and then the init method is responsible for initializing the created instance right. So, it is initializing the instance ok. So, it is an instance method and takes the created instance as its first argument. So, this is the instance method. Okay. And this is initializing the instance and it is taking the instance name as the keyword which self right and it is very typically perform attribute assignments and other instance specific initialization. And it is automatically called after new when you create an object. But also this I told you this might be decided with the to call this in eternal sometimes the init is not called after the new one ok ok. Now, let us just say have an example. This is a simple thing we have seen this in it every time you get a class. So, this in it is defined by this right fine. So, now in this example the init method initial is the value attribute to the opposite based on the argument passed to the construct right in summary. So, what is the summary of these things? So, new is responsible for creating the instance and can be used to customize instance creation. Right? So, we can customize the new method to customize the instance creation while in it is responsible for initializing the instance after it has been created by new. So, we will primarily use init for typical object initializations and while new is used for more advanced scenarios such as working with immutable objects or customizing class creation right. So these things are pretty much handy whether you talk about the meta class and this new and init methods. Okay, so this is the difference between new and init. So let's now discuss about the next thing. We have the call method and it's uses right. So let's just use it. So let's now talk about the call method. So what is the call method? So in Python, the call method is a special method that you can define in a class. So, when we define the call in a class you make instances of the class callable. I will show you later. So just like functions we can call the objects of the class, we can call the instances of the class. So, we can call the instances of the class. So, when you call an instance of a class by using parenthesis, python will invoke the call special method okay the call method of that instance okay so I will show you let us take an example. So, let us create a class class let us suppose call test maybe just just will do one thing will add in it so in it and we can pass let's post two numbers okay number one comma number 1,2. Okay, these two things we will show. Okay now we can add self.num. num1 andnum2, right? So this is the usual way we create the classes. Now here we can define the call method. Just same as we define the init, thing right. So, oxygen KWVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV Otherwise you can just keep it blank if you don't need them. Just par. Whatever you do, if you just don't need them. So now we can introduce something called maybe whatever number 3 right. So, now what we will do here, we will take it returns self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num1 plus self.num2 and we will take this self dot num3 also sorry it is not self just num 3 done. So, this is the simple class we have created till now right. So, no fancy logic ok. So, now what you can do just let us create an instance of the class. So instance or QCl2, call test. And we need number one and number two. So number one we pass as suppose 3 and norm 2 we pass as 4. So, now till this part it is fine right we know these things. Now, what if we are going to so how to call this, just call the instance and we got the num3 write by default. So num3 right by default. So num3 we can pass as, let's suppose 10 right? And we'll get 17 right. So, this is the simple logic actually. So, if you want to make the instance callable, you just pass the call special method in the class, okay. While defining the class, you just mention the call my special method. And then you can just create the instance callable as a callable one. So this is the way we can do these things so that like it is better to make these things very useful. So this is all about the call, nothing fancy, but it is so useful actually. So, that is it. So, let us jump into the next topic. So, let us jump into the next topic which is our last one that is singleton design with Metacloss. So before that what is singleton I will you. I think I've shown you that again. I'll show you. So it shows you, see single con is a creational design pattern which ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides a single point of access to it for any other code ok. So, that is the thing. So, let us now code it out. So, this is our last topic. So, what is this single tone? So, I told you right. But one thing like let us suppose you are creating a class right. So you can create any number of instances, but what if we are not like restrict the user to create only one instance. So, that is called single-tron design. So, let us create it. The first of all we will see how we should know how many number of instances are being created. So you can see this but let us suppose let us create a class. Let us create a meta class. We are not implementing here any kind of single-tone design so we will call it not a single-tone. single down Okay, so we can create a number of instances, but we'll see how many instances we are creating right so that the, let us check it out. So, we will do one thing, we will introduce a variable called instances and we will store the node. and we will store the numbers here, numbers and objects and the class names. So these so these things we are showing here and let's just create a call method. method ok. We need to change it to CSS. Ok fine, yep. So what we do actually, we will do actually? So, we will just store it, okay, CLS dot instances equal to and will store CLS here equal to. Thank you. Thank you. So, we will use this and then we will do one thing, we will just print it, we will see how many instances are being created, so we will see it. Thank you. Now we print it once. Thank you. Okay. will just return simply CLS.instances. So, we will create two classes here. One is one with this not single tone as the meta class and one more. Not single tone. Okay, now let's create two objects here. Now, let's run this. So as you can see, while initializing the first one, we just add one instance because we have created only one instance of it. So we add this one only one and this is the key and value. So, in key we are just storing the name and value we are storing the object itself right. So, this is the thing and second one when we are creating the second instance, we are getting the length of 2. So, we are storing 2 instances here. So, this is how we can like introduce as number of instances as we want. So, by default you can create any number of instances, but if you want to specify the user like they should not use more than one instances. So how to use that? So that is called singleton design. So, we can use this by creating a meta class. So, how to do that? So, let us do this. So, by default you are allowed to create any number of instances, but there comes the usability of meta classes right that you are not allowing the user to create more than one instances. These things you can customize all these things in meta classes. So we have till till now we have just one one instances for each class. So, I am showing you with a not single ton design. So, there is total two instances of two different classes. So, one for each. Now Now if I just create 2 more a 1 equal to 1 a 2 equal to 2. So, if it is not a single dot design it will give us all four of them right as you can see. So, before implementing the single-tone design, we have to see how we can create any number of instances of a single class. So, you can create any number of classes any number of instances right there is no limitation. But what if we are not restrict the user to create only one instance for each class and not talking about meta class. So for each class the user is supposed to create only one instance no matter how many instances they are creating but we are only limiting the user to create only one instance. So that's in going to achieve it single to design. So let's do one thing. implement send real tone meta class to avoid creating more than 1 instance of a class. So, now let us create this class single tone meta class. Let's see it type okay and by default now we are going to do this same thing in send. So, it says. is ok. Now, define the call. Thank you. So, one thing we will introduce here that is the condition if CLS not in CLS should create it cls.inst cls equal to 0 I hope this is understandable. Now let's simply return it. And whenever you want to check what is the length of a view just print the CLS itself. Okay. So now if I create two classes, one, two, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, meter class would be. Thank you. Thanks for watching! And what? And one more thing to notice, if you create two one classes with the different meta classes, will get two objects right. So it is not some magical but yeah it is useful. So let us give it some other name. Thank you. So, now as you can see, so we have created two different classes and two different instances right. So as you can see let us create any number of instances. Thank you. So, if you check the length of it, you just get every time 2 instances right, there is no more than that. We can create a number of instances, let's suppose. Thank you. So if I just run them, as you can see there is a lot of number of instances, but if I just print them, so you get only 2 number of instances, because we have two classes only. So, that is how we are like limiting the number of instances creation to only one. So that is called the singleton design. So that's it for this video.
